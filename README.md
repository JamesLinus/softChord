softChord lyrics editor


Q. What is softChord?

A. softChord is a cross-platform application for storing songs with chords. Chords are linked to individual letters in the songs, and multiple songs make up a "songbook".  There are options for importing and exporting songs from/to various formats, and ability to print nicely-formatted songbooks. 


Q. Where can I download the binaries?

A. http://sourceforge.net/projects/softchord/


Q. What binaries are provided?

A. I periodically compile softChord for Windows and Mac only.  It's based on PyQt, so you can compile it for Linux yourself, if you wish.
